Problem 1:
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_8_5) AppleWebKit/537.73.11 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/6.1.1 Safari/537.73.11

It's using mozilla version 5.0.
My computer is a Mac so it says Macintosh and the 10_8_5 is version. It's using the Intel prosessor
KHTML is and html type engine...that is similar to gecko
Safari is the browser I used.


Problem 2:
Rust probably thinks its unsafe to modify a global variable like this maybe because it's static and every function and other areas it's used, the value changes when it might expect the value to also be stable.
